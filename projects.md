This is a collection of some personal and university projects I've worked. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

I'm also available for consulting, so feel free to [contact me via email](mailto:sami_deiri@hotmail.com?subject=Hello from sdeiri.com) if you'd like to work together.

## JAMKIT Biomimetic Robot Hand with Soft Tactile Sensing - 2020

![UR5 Mount](/img/projects/jamkit/onaur5.JPG){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

This is my MEng Project, where along with a team, we design and build a dexterous, low cost, and 3D printable robot hand with an embedded tactile sensor suited for grasping and manipulation.

## Mammal Inspired Legged Soft Robot - 2019
![UR5 Mount](/img/projects/hexsoftmobilerobot/pictureofrobot.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

This project investigates a proof of concept approach to the design of a textile based leg that is primarily uses easily available
techniques  and  materials.  A  linear  actuator  using  the  transformation  of  an  object  from  a  2d  area  to  a  3d  volumetric  object  is
investigated and tested to produce an operational leg that is used to create a hexapod robot. 

The limitations and strengths of this
type of leg are discussed, with possible gait patterns, actuation steps, and problems/solutions encountered when developing such
a leg. The leg demonstrates clear advantages with regard to simplicity, ease of manufacturing, and low price, however there are
limitations with regards to the materials used in this given they were chosen based on availability rather than optimal properties.
These  materials  were  sufficient  to  demonstrate  a  working  hexapod  robot  with  a  tripod  gait  pattern  to  minimise  the  number  of
regulators  used  to  only  6,  and  creating  a  robot  that  can  achieve  an  almost  %50  reduction  in  its  height  and  therefore  external
volume by deflating the legs.  This project was done under Dr Kaspar Althoefer.
