This is a collection of some personal and university projects I've worked. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

I'm also available for consulting, so feel free to [contact me via email](mailto:sami_deiri@hotmail.com?subject=Hello from sdeiri.com) if you'd like to work together.

## JAMKIT Biomimetic Robot Hand with Soft Tactile Sensing

![UR5 Mount](/img/projects/jamkit/full assem front.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

This is my MEng Project, where along with a team, we design and build a dexterous, low cost, and 3D printable robot hand with an embedded tactile sensor suited for grasping and manipulation.

## Mammal Inspired Legged Soft Robot
![Walking Soft robot](/img/projects/hexsoftmobilerobot/pictureofrobot.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Concept design of a textile based leg that primarily uses easily available
techniques  and  materials.  A  linear  actuator  using  the  transformation  of  an  object  from  a  2d  area  to  a  3d  volumetric  object  is
investigated and tested to produce an operational leg that is used to create a hexapod robot. 

Check out the project [here](_posts/2019-06-28-leggedsoftrobot.md)
