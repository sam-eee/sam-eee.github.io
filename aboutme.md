I've just finished my final year for a Robotics Masters of Engineering at the Queen Mary University of London, currently being advised by <a href="https://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/staff/k.althoefer">Dr. Kaspar Althoefer</a> and <a href="http://lorejam.blogspot.com/">Dr. Lorenzo Jamone</a>.
My research interest is in the design and implementation of innovative robotics systems, ranging from the electro-mechanical design to the control and systems engineering.

I am currently working on a low cost robotic hand design utilising 3 axis tactile sensors to provide reliable in-hand manipulation.  [Github](https://github.com/sam-eee/jamkit_robot_hand)
